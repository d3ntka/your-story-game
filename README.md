# your-story-game
Game in ren'py on which I worked for about two years with some breaks. I started development in January of 2020, and initialized this repo after a year. Project was run poorly in this time, was remade several times and finally was 'restarted' without original graphic designer in 2022. I was led to believe that am cofounder of project, but nope, only used. I left because of burnout, bad times and laughable compensation offer. Feel free to use parts of it as finally I was not compensated in any way for my work.
